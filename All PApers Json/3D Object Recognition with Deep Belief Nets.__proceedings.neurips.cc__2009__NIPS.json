The top-level model is a third-order\nBoltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both\ngenerative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the\nNORB database ( normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair\nimages of objects under diﬀerent lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our\nmodel achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best pub-\nlished result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has\nbuilt-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperfor ms\nshallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for\nsemi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate th",
