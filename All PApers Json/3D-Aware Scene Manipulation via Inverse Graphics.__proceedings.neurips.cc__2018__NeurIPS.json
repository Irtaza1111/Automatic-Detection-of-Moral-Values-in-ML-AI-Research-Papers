In this work, we propose 3D\nscene de-rendering networks (3D-SDN) to address the above issues by integrating\ndisentangled representations for semantics, geometry, and appearance into a deep\ngenerative model. Our scene encoder performs inverse graphics, translating a scene\ninto a structured object-wise representation. Our decoder has two components: a\ndifferentiable shape renderer and a neural texture generator. The disenta",
