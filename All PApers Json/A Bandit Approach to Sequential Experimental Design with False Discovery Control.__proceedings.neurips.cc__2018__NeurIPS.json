Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA, and\n†Optimizely, San Francisco, CA\nAbstract\nWe propose an adaptive sampling approach for multiple testing which aims to\nmaximize statistical power while ensuring anytime false discovery control. We\nconsider n distributions whose means are partitioned by whether they are below or\nequal to a baseline (nulls), versus above the baseline (actual positives). In addition,\neach distribution can be sequentially and repeatedly sampled. Inspired by the\nmulti-armed bandit literature, we provide an algorithm that takes as few samples\nas possible to exceed a target true positive proportion (i.e. proportion of actual\npositives discovered) while giving anytime control of the false discovery proportion\n(nulls predicted as actual positives). Our sample complexity results match ",
