In these experiments, a subject ﬁrst studies a list of words and then\ntries to recall them. To model these data, we draw on both previous psychological\nresearch and statistical topic models of text documents. We assume that memories\nare formed by assimilating the semantic meaning of studied words (represented\nas a distribution over topics) into a slowly changing latent con",
