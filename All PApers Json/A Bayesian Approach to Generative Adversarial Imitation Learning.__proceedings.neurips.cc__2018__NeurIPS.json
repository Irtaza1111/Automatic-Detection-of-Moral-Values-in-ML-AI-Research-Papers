This paradigm is based on\nreducing the imitation learning problem to the density matching problem, where\nthe agent iteratively reﬁnes the policy to match the empirical state-action visitation\nfrequency of the expert demonstration. Although this approach can robustly learn\nto imitate even with scarce demonstration, one must still address the inherent\nchallenge that collecting trajectory samples in each iteration is a costly operation. To\naddress this issue, we ﬁrst propose a Bayesian formulation of generative adversarial\nimitation learning (GAIL), where the imitation policy and the cost function are\nrepresented as stochastic neu",
