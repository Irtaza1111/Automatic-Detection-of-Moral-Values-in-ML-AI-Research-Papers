The model clusters the images into classes, and\neach image is segmented into a set of objects, also allowing the opportunity to\nassign a word to each object (localized labeling). Each object is assumed to be\nrepresented as a heterogeneous mix of components, with this realized via mixture\nmodels linking image features to object types. The number of image classes, num-\nber of object types, and the characteristics of the object-feature mixture models\nare inferred nonparametrically. To constitute sp",
