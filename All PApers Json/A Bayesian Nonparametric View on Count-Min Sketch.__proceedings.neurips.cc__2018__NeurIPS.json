Adams\nPrinceton University\nrpa@princeton.edu\nAbstract\nThe count-min sketch is a time- and memory-efﬁcient randomized data structure\nthat provides a point estimate of the number of times an item has appeared in a data\nstream. The count-min sketch and related hash-based data structures are ubiquitous\nin systems that must track frequencies of data such as URLs, IP addresses, and\nlanguage n-grams. We present a Bayesian view on the count-min sketch, using\nthe same data structure, but providing a posterior distribution over the frequencies\nthat characterizes the uncertainty arising from the hash-based approximation. In\nparticular, we take a nonparametric approach and consider tokens generated from a\nDirichlet process (DP) random measure, which allows for an unbounded number\nof unique tokens.
