The\nmean-variance function is one of the most widely used objective functions in risk\nmanagement due to its simplicity and interpretability. Existing algorithms for\nmean-variance optimization are based on multi-time-scale stochastic approxima-\ntion, whose learning rate schedules are often hard to tune, and have only asymptotic\nconvergence proof. In this paper, we develop a model-free policy search frame-\nwork for mean-variance op",
