However, generally designed schemat-\nic iterations may hard to investigate complex data distributions in real-world appli-\ncations. Recently, training deep propagations (i.e., networks) has gained promising\nperformance in some particular tasks. Unfortunately, existing networks are often\nbuilt in heuristic manners, thus lack of principled interpretations and solid theoreti-\ncal supports. In this work, we provide a new paradigm, named Propagation and\nOptimization based Deep Mode",
