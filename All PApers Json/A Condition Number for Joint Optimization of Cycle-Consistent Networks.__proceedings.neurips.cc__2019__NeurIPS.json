In this\ncontext, there is a naturalcycle-consistency constraint, which regularizes composite\nmaps associated with cycles, i.e., they are forced to be identity maps. However,\nas there is an exponential number of cycles in a graph, how to sample a subset\nof cycles becomes critical for efﬁcient and effective enforcement of the cycle-\nconsistency constraint. This paper presents an algorithm that select a subset of\nweighted cycles to minimize a condition number of the induced joint optimization\nproblem. Experimental results on benchmark datasets justify the effectiveness of\nour approach for optimizing dense correspondences between 3D shapes and neural\nnet",
