Given an unconstrained discrimi-\nnator able to approximate any function, this game reduces to ﬁnding the generative\nmodel minimizing a divergence score, e.g. the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, to\nthe data distribution. However, in practice the discriminator is constrained to be\nin a smaller class Fsuch as convolutional neural nets. Then, a natural question is\nhow the divergence minimization interpretation will change as we constrain F. In\nthis work, we address this question by developing a convex duality framework for\nanalyzing GAN minimax problems. For a convex set F, this duality framework\ninterprets the original vanilla GAN problem as ﬁnding the generative model with\nthe m",
