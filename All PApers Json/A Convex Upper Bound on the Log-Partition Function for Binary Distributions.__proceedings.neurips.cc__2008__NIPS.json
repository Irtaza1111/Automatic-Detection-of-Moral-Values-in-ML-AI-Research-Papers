We introduce a new bound, the cardinality\nbound, which can be computed via convex optimization. The corresponding error on the log-\npartition function is bounded above by twice the distance, in model parameter space, to a class of\n“standard” Ising models, for which variable inter-dependence is described via a simple mean ﬁeld\nterm. In the context of maximum-likelihood, using the new bound instead of the exact log-partition\nfunction, while constraining the dista",
