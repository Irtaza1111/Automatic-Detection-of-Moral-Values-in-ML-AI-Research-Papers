To understand how these models make\npredictions, people routinely turn to feature importance measures calculated from\ntree ensembles. It has long been known that Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), one\nof the most widely used measures of feature importance, incorrectly assigns high\nimportance to noisy features, leading to systematic bias in feature selection. In\nthis paper, we address the feature selection bias of MDI from both",
