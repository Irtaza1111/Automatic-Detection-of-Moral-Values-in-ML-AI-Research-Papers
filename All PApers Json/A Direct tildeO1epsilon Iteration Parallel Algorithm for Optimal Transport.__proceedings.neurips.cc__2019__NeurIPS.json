We give an algorithm which solves the\nproblem to additive ϵ accuracy with ˜O(1/ϵ) parallel depth and ˜O\n(\nn2/ϵ\n)\nwork.\n[BJKS18, Qua19] obtained this runtime through reductions to positive linear pro-\ngramming and matrix scaling. However, these reduction-based algorithms use\nsubroutines which may be impractical due to requiring solvers for second-order\niterations (matrix scaling) or non-parallelizability (positive LP). Our methods\nmatch the previous-best work bounds by [BJKS18, Qua19] while either improv-\ning parallelization or removing the need for linear system solves, and improve\nupon the previous best",
