Evalua-\ntions are essential for: (i) relative assessment of different models and (ii) monitoring\nthe progress of a single model throughout training. The latter cannot be determined\nby simply inspecting the generator and discriminator loss curves as they behave\nnon-intuitively . W e leverage the notion of duality gap from game theory to propose\na measure that addresses both (i) and (ii) at a low computational cost. Exten-\nsive experiments show the effectiveness of this measure to rank different GAN\nmodels and capture the typical GAN failure scen",
