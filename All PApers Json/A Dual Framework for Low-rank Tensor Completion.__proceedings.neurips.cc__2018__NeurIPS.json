However, most existing works in this direction learn a\nsparse combination of tensors. In this work, we ﬁll this gap by proposing a variant\nof the latent trace norm that helps in learning a non-sparse combination of tensors.\nWe develop a dual framework for solving the low-rank tensor completion problem.\nWe ﬁrst show a novel characterization of the dual solution space with an interesting\nfactorization of the optimal solution. Overall, the optimal solution is shown to lie on\na Cartesian product of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we exploit the versatile\nRiemannian optimization framework for proposing computationally efﬁcient trust\nregion algorithm. The ex",
