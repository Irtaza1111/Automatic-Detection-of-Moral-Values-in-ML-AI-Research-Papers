T., Hong Kong\n{jjli,hsen,manchoso}@se.cuhk.edu.hk\nAbstract\nWasserstein distance-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has received\nmuch attention lately due to its ability to provide a robustness interpretation of\nvarious learning models. Moreover, many of the DRO problems that arise in the\nlearning context admits exact convex reformulations and hence can be tackled\nby off-the-shelf solvers. Nevertheless, the use of such solvers severely limits the\napplicability of DRO in large-scale learning problems, as they often rely on general\npurpose interior-point algorithms. On the other hand, there are very few works\nthat attempt to develop fast iterative methods to solve these DRO problems, which\ntypically possess complicated structures. In th",
