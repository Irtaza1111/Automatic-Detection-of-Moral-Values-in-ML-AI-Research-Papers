Relational information among the data samples,\noften encoded in the graph/network structure, is shown to be helpful for these\nsemi-supervised learning tasks. However, conventional graph-based regularization\nmethods and recent graph neural networks do not fully leverage the interrelations\nbetween the features, the graph, and the labels. In this work, we propose a ﬂexible\ngenerative framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning, which approaches\nthe joint distribution of the node features, labels, and the graph structure.
