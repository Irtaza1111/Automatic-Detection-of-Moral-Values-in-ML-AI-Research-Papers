The selection can\nbe optimized post-hoc for trained models or incorporated directly into the method\nitself (self-explaining). However, an overall selection does not properly capture the\nmulti-faceted nature of useful rationales such as pros and cons for decisions. To this\nend, we propose a new game theoretic approach to class-dependent rationalization,\nwhere the method is speciﬁcally trained to highlight evidence supporting alternative\nconclusions. Each class involves three players set up competitively to ﬁnd evidence\nfor factual and counterfactual scenarios. We show theoretically in a simpliﬁed\nsc",
