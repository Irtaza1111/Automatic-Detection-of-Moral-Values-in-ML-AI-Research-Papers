Such systems should be fair and stable. Showing\nthat traditional approaches fail to satisfy these requirements, we propose the Shap-\nley mediator. We show that the Shapley mediator fulﬁlls the fairness and stability\nrequirements, runs in linear time, and is the only economically efﬁcient mechanism\nsatisfying these properties.\n1 Introduction\nRecommendation systems (RSs hereinafter) have rapidly developed over the past decade.
