The factor graph that\ncorresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence,\napplying the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. The al-\ngorithm described here is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian\ndensity of the unconstrained linear system. It is shown that even though the ap-\nproximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the\nBP algorithm to the modiﬁed factor graph outperforms current methods in terms\nof both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO de",
