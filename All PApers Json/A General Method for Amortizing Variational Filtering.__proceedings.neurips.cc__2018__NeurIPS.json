The algorithm\nis derived from the variational objective in the ﬁltering setting and consists of an op-\ntimization procedure at each time step. By performing each inference optimization\nprocedure with an iterative amortized inference model, we obtain a computationally\nefﬁcient implementation of the algorithm, which we call amortized variational\nﬁltering. We present experiments demonstrating that this general-purpose method\nimproves performance across several deep dynamical latent variable models.\n1 Introduction\nComplex tasks with time-series data, like audio comprehension or robotic m",
