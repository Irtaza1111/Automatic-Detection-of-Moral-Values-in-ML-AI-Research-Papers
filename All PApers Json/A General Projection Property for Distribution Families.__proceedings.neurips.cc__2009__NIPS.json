We further\nextend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints,\nsuch as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with\nclassic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural\nrisk criteria arising in classiﬁcation, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov\ndecision processes.\n1 Introduction\nIn real applications, the model of the problem at hand inevitably embodies some form of uncertainty:\nthe parameters of the model are usually (roughly) estimated from data, which themselves can be\nuncertain due to various kinds",
