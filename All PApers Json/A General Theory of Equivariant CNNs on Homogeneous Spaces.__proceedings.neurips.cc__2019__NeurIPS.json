Feature\nmaps in these networks represent ﬁelds on a homogeneous base space, and layers\nare equivariant maps between spaces of ﬁelds. The theory enables a systematic\nclassiﬁcation of all existing G-CNNs in terms of their symmetry group, base\nspace, and ﬁeld type. W e also consider a fundamental question: what is the most\ngeneral kind of equivariant linear map between feature spaces (ﬁelds) of given\ntypes? Following Mackey , we show that such maps correspond one-to-one with\nconvolutions using equivariant kernels, and characterize the space of such kernels.\n1",
