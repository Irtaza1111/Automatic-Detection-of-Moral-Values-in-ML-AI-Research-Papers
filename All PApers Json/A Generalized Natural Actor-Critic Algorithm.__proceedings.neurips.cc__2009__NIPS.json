In addition, extensions based on the concept of the Natural\nGradient (NG) show promising learning ef\u0002ciency because these regard metrics\nfor the task. Though there are two candidate metrics, Kakade's Fisher Information\nMatrix (FIM) for the policy (action) distribution and Morimura's FIM for the state-\naction joint distribution, but all RL algorithms with NG have followed Kakade's\napproach. In this paper, we describe a generalized Natural Gradient (gNG) that\nlinearly interpolates the two FIMs and propose an ef\u0002cient implementation for the\n",
