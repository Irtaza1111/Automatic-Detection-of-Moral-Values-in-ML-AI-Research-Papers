Speciﬁcally , we extend the Catalyst approach originally designed for\ndeterministic objectives to the stochastic setting. Given an optimization method\nwith mild convergence guarantees for strongly convex problems, the challenge is to\naccelerate convergence to a noise-dominated region, and then achieve convergence\nwith an optimal worst-case complexity depending on the noise variance of the\ngradients. A side contribution of our work is also a generic analysis that can\nhandle inexact proximal operators, providing new insights about the robustness of\nstochastic algorithms w",
