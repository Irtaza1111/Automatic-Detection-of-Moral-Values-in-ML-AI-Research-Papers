However, solving optimal trans-\nport exactly can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, there has been signiﬁcant\neffort towards the design of scalable approximation algorithms. Previous combina-\ntorial results [Sharathkumar, Agarwal STOC ’12, Agarwal, Sharathkumar STOC\n’14] have focused primarily on the design of near-linear time multiplicative approx-\nimation algorithms. There has also been an effort to design approximate solutions\nwith additive errors [Cuturi NIPS ’13, Altschuleret al. NIPS ’17, Dvurechenskyet\nal. ICML ’18, Quanrud, SOSA ’19] ",
