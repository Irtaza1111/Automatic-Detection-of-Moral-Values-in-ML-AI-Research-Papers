In this paper, we will propose a novel and efﬁcient recomputation\nmethod that can be applied to a wider range of neural nets than previous methods.\nWe use the language of graph theory to formalize the general recomputation\nproblem of minimizing the computational overhead under a ﬁxed memory budget\nconstraint, and ",
