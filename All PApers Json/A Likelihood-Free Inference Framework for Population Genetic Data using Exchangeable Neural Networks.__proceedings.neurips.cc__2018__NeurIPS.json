Re-\ncent work in population genetics has centered on designing inference methods\nfor relatively simple model classes, and few scalable general-purpose inference\ntechniques exist for more realistic, complex models. To achieve this, two inferential\nchallenges need to be addressed: (1) population data are exchangeable, calling\nfor methods that ",
