Previous attack models assume that the\nrogue participants (a) are omniscient (know the data of all other participants),\nand (b) introduce large changes to the parameters. Accordingly, most defense\nmechanisms make a similar assumption and attempt to use statistically robust\nmethods to identify and discard values whose reported gradients are far from the\npopulation mean. We observe that if the empirical variance between the gradients\nof workers is high enough, an attacker could take advantage of th",
