Groups of VPEs operate in SIMD \n(single instruction multiple data) mode, and each group is connected to an \nindependent memory bank . The memory bandwidth thus scales with the \nnumber of VPEs, while the main data flows are local, keeping power dissipation \nlow. With 256 VPEs, implemented on two FPGA s",
