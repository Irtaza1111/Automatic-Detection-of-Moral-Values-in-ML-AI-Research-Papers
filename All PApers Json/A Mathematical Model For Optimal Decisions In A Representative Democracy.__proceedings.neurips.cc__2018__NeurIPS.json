This happens in noisy settings when voters have lim-\nited information. Representative democracy, where voters choose representatives to\nvote, can be an elixir in both these situations. We introduce a mathematical model\nfor studying representative democracy, in particular understanding the parameters\nof a representative democracy that gives maximum decision making capability. Our\nmain result states that under general and natural conditions,\n1. for ﬁxed voting cost, the optimal number of representatives is linear;\n2. for polynomial cost, the optimal number of representatives is loga",
