We apply mean ﬁeld techniques\nto networks with quantized activations in order to evaluate the degree to which\nquantization degrades signal propagation at initialization. We derive initialization\nschemes which maximize signal propagation in such networks, and suggest why\nthis is helpful for generalization. Building on these results, we obtain a closed\nform implicit equation for Lmax, the maximal trainable depth (and hence model\ncapacity), given N, the number of quantization levels in the activation function.\nSolving this equation nume",
