Our analysis is based on over one hundred machine\nlearning competitions hosted on the Kaggle platform over the course of several\nyears. In each competition, numerous practitioners repeatedly evaluated their\nprogress against a holdout set that forms the basis of a public ranking available\nthroughout the competition. Performance on a separate test set used only once\ndetermined the ﬁnal ranking. By systematically comparing the public ranking\nwith the ﬁnal ranking, we assess how much pa",
