Here we model such learned Bloom ﬁlters ,\nwith the following outcomes: (1) we clarify what guarantees can and cannot be\nassociated with such a structure; (2) we show how to estimate what size the learning\nfunction must obtain in order to obtain improved performance; (3) we provide a\nsimple method, sandwiching, for optimizing learned Bloom ﬁlters; and (4) we\npropose a design and analysis approach for a learned Bloomier ﬁlter, based on our\nmodeling approach.\n1 Introduction\nAn interesting recent paper, “The Case for Learned Index Structures” [7], argues that standard index\nstructures and related structures, such as Blo",
