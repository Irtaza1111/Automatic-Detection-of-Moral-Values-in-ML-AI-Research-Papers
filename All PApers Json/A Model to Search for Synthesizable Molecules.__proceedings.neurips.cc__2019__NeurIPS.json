While such models allow\none to generate molecules with desirable properties, they give no guarantees that\nthe molecules can actually be synthesized in practice. We propose a new molecule\ngeneration model, mirroring a more realistic real-world process, where (a) reactants\nare selected, and (b) combined to form more complex molec",
