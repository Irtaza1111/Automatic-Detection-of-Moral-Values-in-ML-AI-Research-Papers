Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, W A\nAbstract\nIn many scientiﬁc settings there is a need for adaptive experimental design to guide\nthe process of identifying regions of the search space that contain as many true\npositives as possible subject to a low rate of false discoveries (i.e. false alarms).\nSuch regions of the search space could differ drastically from a predicted set\nthat minimizes 0/1 error and accurate identiﬁcation could require very different\nsampling strategies. Like active learning for binary classiﬁcation, this experimental\ndesign cannot be optimally chosen a priori, but rather the data must be taken\nsequentially and adaptively. However, unlike classiﬁcation with 0/1 error, collecting\ndata adaptively to ﬁnd a set with high true positive rate and low false discovery\nrate (FD",
