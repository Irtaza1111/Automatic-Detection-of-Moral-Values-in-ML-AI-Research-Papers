We formu-\nlate the task as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. Under mild\nstatistical assumptions of the data, we prove that the vanilla Riemannian gradient\ndescent (RGD) method, with random initializations, provably recovers both the\nkernel a and the signals txiup\ni\u00101 up to a signed shift ambiguity. In comparison\nwith state-of-the-art results, our work shows signiﬁcant improvements in terms\nof sample complexity and computational efﬁciency. Our theoretical results are\ncorroborated by numerical experiments, whi",
