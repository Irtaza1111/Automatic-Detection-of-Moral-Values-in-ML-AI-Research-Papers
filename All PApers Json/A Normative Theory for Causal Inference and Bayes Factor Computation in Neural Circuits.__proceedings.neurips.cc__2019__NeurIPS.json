In both cognitive processes such as causal\nreasoning and perceptual inference such as cue integration, the nervous systems\nneed to choose different models representing the underlying causal structures\nwhen making inferences on external stimuli. In multisensory processing, for\nexample, the nervous system has to choose whether to integrate or segregate inputs\nfrom different se",
