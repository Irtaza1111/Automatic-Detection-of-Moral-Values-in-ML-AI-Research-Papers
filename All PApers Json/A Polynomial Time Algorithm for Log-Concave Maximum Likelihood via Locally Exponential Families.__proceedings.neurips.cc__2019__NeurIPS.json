Speciﬁcally, we present an algorithm which,\ngiven n points inRd and an accuracy parameter✏> 0, runs in timepoly(n, d,1/✏),\nand returns a log-concave distribution which, with high probability, has the property\nthat the likelihood of then points under the returned distribution is at most an\nadditive ✏ less than the maximum ",
