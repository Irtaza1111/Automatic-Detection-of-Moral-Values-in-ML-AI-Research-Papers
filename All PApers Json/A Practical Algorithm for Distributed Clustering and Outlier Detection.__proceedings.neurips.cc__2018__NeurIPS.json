We propose a simple approach based on constructing small\nsummary for the original dataset. The proposed method is time and communication\nefﬁcient, has good approximation guarantees, and can identify the global outliers\neffectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst practical algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees for distributed clustering with outliers. Our experiments\non both real and synthetic",
