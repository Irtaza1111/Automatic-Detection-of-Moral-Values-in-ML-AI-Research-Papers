Most popular models—Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (V AEs)—usually employ a stan-\ndard Gaussian distribution as a prior. Previous works show that the richer family\nof prior distributions may help to avoid the mode collapse problem in GANs and\nto improve the evidence lower bound in V AEs. We propose a new family of prior\ndistributions—Tensor Ring Induced Prior (TRIP)—that packs an exponential num-\nber of Gaussians into a high-dimensional lattice with a relatively small number\nof parameters. We show that these priors improve Fréchet Inception Di",
