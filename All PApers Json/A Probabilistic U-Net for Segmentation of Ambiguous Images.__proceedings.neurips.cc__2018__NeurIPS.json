In clinical\napplications for example, it might not be clear from a CT scan alone which par-\nticular region is cancer tissue. Therefore a group of graders typically produces\na set of diverse but plausible segmentations. We consider the task of learning a\ndistribution over segmentations given an input. To this end we propose a generative\nsegmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with a conditional vari-\national autoencoder that is capable of efﬁciently pr",
