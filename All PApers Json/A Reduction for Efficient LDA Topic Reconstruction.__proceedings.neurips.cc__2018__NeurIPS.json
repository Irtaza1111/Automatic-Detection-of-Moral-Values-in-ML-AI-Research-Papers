The main technical idea is to show that the distribution over the documents\ngenerated by LDA can be transformed into a distribution for a much simpler genera-\ntive model in which documents are generated fromthe same set of topics but have a\nmuch simpler structure: documents are single topic and topics are chosen uniformly\nat random. Furthermore, this reduction is approximation preserving, in the sense\nthat approximate distributions — the only ones we can hope to compute in practice\n— are mapped into approximate distribution in the simpliﬁed world.
