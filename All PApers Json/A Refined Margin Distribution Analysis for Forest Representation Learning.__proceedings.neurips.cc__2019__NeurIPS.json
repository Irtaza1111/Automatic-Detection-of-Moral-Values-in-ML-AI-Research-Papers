  "text": "A Reﬁned Margin Distribution Analysis for Forest\nRepresentation Learning\nShen-Huan Lyu, Liang Yang, Zhi-Hua Zhou\nNational Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology\nNanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China\n{lvsh,yangl,zhouzh}@lamda.nju.edu.cn\nAbstract\nIn this paper, we formulate the forest representation learning approach named\ncasForest as an additive model, and show that the generalization error can be\nbounded by O(ln m/m), when the margin ratio related to the margin standard\ndeviation against the margin mean is sufﬁciently small. This inspires us to optimize\nthe ratio. To this end, we design a margin distribution reweighting approach for the\ndeep forest model to attain a small margin ratio. Experiments conﬁrm the relation\nbetween the margin distribution and generalization performance. We remark that\nthis study offers a novel understanding of casForest from the perspective of the\nmargin theory and further guides the layer-by-layer forest representation learning.\n1 Introduction\nIn",
