With this\nmotivation, we propose an approach that ﬁrst retrieves a training example based on\nthe input (e.g., natural language description) and then edits it to the desired output\n(e.g., code). Our contribution is a computationally efﬁcient method for learning\na retrieval model that embeds the input in a task-dependent way without relying\non a hand-crafted metric or incurring the expense of jointly training the retriever\nwith the edi",
