In this paper, we consider\nthe problem of contextual auctions where the seller gradually learns a model of\nthe buyer’s valuation as a function of the context (e.g., item features) and seeks a\npricing policy that optimizes revenue. Building on the concept of a bank account\nmechanism—a special class of dynamic mechanisms that is known to be revenue-\noptimal—we develop a non-clairvoyant dynamic mechanism that is robust to both\nes",
