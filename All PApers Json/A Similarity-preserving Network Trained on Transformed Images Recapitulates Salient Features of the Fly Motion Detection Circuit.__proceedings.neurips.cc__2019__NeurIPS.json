An example of such prob-\nlem is unsupervised learning of a visual motion detector from pairs of consecutive\nvideo frames. Rao and Ruderman formulated this problem in terms of learning\ninﬁnitesimal transformation operators (Lie group generators) via minimizing image\nreconstruction error. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to map their model onto a biologi-\ncally plausible neural network (NN) with local learning rules. Here we propose a\nbiologically plausible model of motion detection. We also adopt the transforma",
