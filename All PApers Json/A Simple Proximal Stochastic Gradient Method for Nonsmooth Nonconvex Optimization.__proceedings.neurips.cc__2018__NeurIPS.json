In particular, the objective function is given by the summation\nof a differentiable (possibly nonconvex) component, together with a possibly non-\ndifferentiable but convex component. We propose a proximal stochastic gradient\nalgorithm based on variance reduction, called ProxSVRG+. Our main contribution\nlies in the analysis of ProxSVRG+. It recovers several existing convergence results\nand improves/generalizes them (in terms of the number of stochastic gradient\noracle calls and proximal oracle calls). In particular, ProxSVRG+ generalizes\nthe best results given by the SCSG algorithm, recently proposed by [Lei et al.,\n2017] for the smooth nonconvex case. ProxSVRG+ is also more",
