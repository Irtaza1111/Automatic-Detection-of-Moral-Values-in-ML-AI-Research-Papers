Moallemi\nGSB, Columbia University\nciamac@gsb.columbia.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a novel linear program for the approximation of the dynamic\nprogramming cost-to-go function in high-dimensional stochastic control\nproblems. LP approaches to approximate DP naturally restrict attention\nto approximations that are lower bounds to the optimal cost-to-go func-\ntion. Our program – the ‘smoothed approximate linear program’ – relaxes\nthis restriction in an appropriate fashion while remaining computation-\nally tractable. Doing so appears to have several advantages: First, we\ndemonstrate superior bounds on the quality of approximation to the op-\ntimal cost-to-go function aﬀorded by our approach. Second, experiments\nwith our approach on a challenging problem (the game of Tetris) show that\nthe approach outperforms the existing LP approach (which has previ",
