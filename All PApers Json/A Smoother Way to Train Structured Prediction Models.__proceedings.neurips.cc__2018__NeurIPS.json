Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and Department of Statistics\nUniversity of Washington\nname@uw.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a framework to train a structured prediction model by performing\nsmoothing on the inference algorithm it builds upon. Smoothing overcomes the\nnon-smoothness inherent to the maximum margin structured prediction objective,\nand paves the way for the use of fast primal gradient-based optimization algorithms.\nWe illustrate the proposed framework by developing a novel primal incremental\noptimization algorithm for the structural support vector machine. The proposed\nalgorithm blends an extrapolation scheme for acceleration and an adaptive smooth-\ning scheme and builds upon the stochastic variance-reduced gradient algorithm.\nWe establish its worst-case global complexity bound and study several practical\nvariants. We present experimental res",
