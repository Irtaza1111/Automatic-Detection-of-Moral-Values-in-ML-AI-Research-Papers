Our approach makes use of training d ata which\nallows us to learn representations of the types of sounds tha t compose the\nmixture. In contrast to popular methods that attempt to extr act com-\npact generalizable models for each sound from training data , we employ\nthe training data itself as a representation of the sources i n the mixture.\nW e show that mixtures of known sounds can be described as spar se com-\nbinations of the training data itself, and in doing so produc e signiﬁcantly\nbetter separation results as compared to similar systems ba sed on compact\nstatistical models.\nKeywords: Example-Based Representation, Signal Separation, Sparse M",
