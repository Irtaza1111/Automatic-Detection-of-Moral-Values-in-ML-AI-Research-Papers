Geometric deep learning corresponds to techniques that\ngeneralize deep neural network models to such non-Euclidean spaces. Several\nrecent papers have shown how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be\nextended to learn with graph-based data. In this work, we study the setting where\nthe data (or measurements) are ordered, longitudinal or temporal in nature and live\non a Riemannian manifold – this setting is common in a variety of problems in\nstatistical machine learning, vision and medical imaging. We show how recurrent\nstatistical network models can be deﬁ",
