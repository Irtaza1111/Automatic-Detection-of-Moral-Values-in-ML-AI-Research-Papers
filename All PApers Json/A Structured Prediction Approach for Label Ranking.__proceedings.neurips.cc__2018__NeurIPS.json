We use speciﬁc feature maps/embeddings for\nranking data, which convert any ranking/permutation into a vector representation.\nThese embeddings are all well-tailored for our approach, either by resulting in\nconsistent estimators, or by solving trivially the pre-image problem which is often\nthe bottleneck in structured prediction. Their extension to the case of incomplete or\npartial rankings is also discussed. Finally, we provide empirical results on synthetic\nand real-world datasets showing the re",
