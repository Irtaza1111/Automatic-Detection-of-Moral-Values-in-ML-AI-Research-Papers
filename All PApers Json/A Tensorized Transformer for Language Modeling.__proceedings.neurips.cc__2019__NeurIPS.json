In particular, Transformer, which is solely\nbased on self-attention, has led to breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks. However, the multi-head attention mechanism, as a key component\nof Transformer, limits the effective deployment of the model to a resource-limited\nsetting. In this paper, based on the ideas of tensor decomposition and parameters\nsharing, we propose a novel self-attention model (namely Multi-line",
