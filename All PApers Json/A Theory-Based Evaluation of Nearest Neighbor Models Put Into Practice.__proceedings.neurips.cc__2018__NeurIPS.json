This concept is crucial in many areas of data analysis and data\nprocessing, e.g., computer vision, document retrieval and machine learning. Many\nk-NN algorithms have been published and implemented, but often the relation\nbetween parameters and accuracy of the computed k-NN is not explicit. We study\nproperty testing of k-NN graphs in theory and evaluate it empirically: given a point\nset P ⊂Rδ and a directed graph G= (P,E), is Ga k-NN graph, i.e., every point\np ∈P has outgoing edges to its k nearest neighbors, or is it ϵ-far from being a\nk-NN graph? Here, ϵ-far means that on",
