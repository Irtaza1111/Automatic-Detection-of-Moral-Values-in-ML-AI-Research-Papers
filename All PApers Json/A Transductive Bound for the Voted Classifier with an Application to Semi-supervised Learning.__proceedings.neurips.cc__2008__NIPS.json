The ﬁrst one involves the margin distribution of the clas-\nsiﬁer and a risk bound on its associate Gibbs classiﬁer. The bound is tight when so is\nthe Gibbs’s bound and when the errors of the majority vote classiﬁer is concentrated on a\nzone of low margin. In semi-supervised learning, considering the margin as an indicator\nof conﬁdence constitutes the working hypothesis of algorithms which search the decision\nboundary on l",
