In the model, all stimuli are represented both as unindividu-\nated wholes and as a series of temporal elements with varying delays. These two\nstimulus representations interact, producing different patterns of learning in trace\nand delay conditioning. The model proposes that hippocampal lesions eliminate\nlong-latency temporal elements, but preserve short-latency temporal elements. For\ntrace conditioning, with no contiguity between cue and reward, these lon",
