We consider the case wherex and w have\nknown signs and are sparse with respect to known dictionaries of sizeK and N,\nrespectively. Here,K and N may be larger than, smaller than, or equal toL.W e\nintroduce `1-BranchHull, which is a convex program posed in the natural parameter\nspace and does not require an approximate solution or initialization in order to\nbe stated or solved. We study the case wherex and w are S1- and S2-sparse\nwith res",
