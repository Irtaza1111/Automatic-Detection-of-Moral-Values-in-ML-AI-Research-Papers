In this work we propose a\nunifying framework that can handle and combine varying types of less-demanding\nweak supervision. Our model is based on discriminative clustering and integrates\ndifferent types of supervision as constraints on the optimization. We investigate\napplications of such a model to training setups with alternative supervisory signals\nranging from video-level class labels to the full per-frame annotation of action\nbounding boxes. Experiments on the challenging UCF101-24 and DALY datasets\ndemonstrate competitive pe",
