Whether neural correlation is important or not\nin decoding neural activities is of special interest. We have developed a general\nframework for investigating how far the decoding process in the brain can be sim-\npliﬁed. First, we hierarchically construct simpliﬁed probabilistic models of neu-\nral responses that ignore more thanKth-order correlations by using a maximum\nentropy principle. Then, we compute how much information is lost when infor-\nmation is deco",
