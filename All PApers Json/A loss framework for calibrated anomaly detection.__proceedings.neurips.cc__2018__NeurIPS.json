Williamson\nAustralian National University\nbob.williamson@anu.edu.au\nAbstract\nGiven samples from a distribution, anomaly detection is the problem of determining\nif a given point lies in a low-density region. This paper concernscalibrated anomaly\ndetection, which is the practically relevant extension where we additionally wish to\nproduce a conﬁdence score for a point being anomalous. Building on a classiﬁcation\nframework for standard anomaly detection, we show how minimisation of a suitable\nproper loss produces density estimates only for anomalous instances. These are\nshown to naturally relate to the pinball loss, which provides implicit quantile\ncontrol. Finally, leveraging a result from point processes, we show how to efﬁciently\noptimise a special case of the objective with kernelised scores. Our framework is\nshown to incorporate a close relative of t",
