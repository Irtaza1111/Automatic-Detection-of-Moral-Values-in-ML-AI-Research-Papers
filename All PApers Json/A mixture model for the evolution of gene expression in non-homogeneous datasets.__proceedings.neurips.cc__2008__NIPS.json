Recent studies have demonstrated the success\nof probabilistic models in studying the evolution of gene expression in simple\neukaryotic organisms such as yeast, for which measurements are typically scalar\nand independent. Models capable of studying expression evolution in much more\ncomplex organisms such as vertebrates are particularly important given the medi-\ncal and scientiﬁc interest in species such as human and mouse.
