How these beliefs are computed and represented by neural\nresponses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A central debate\nconcerns the question of whether neural responses represent samples of latent\nvariables (Hoyer & Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their distributions (Ma et al.\n2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between them (Grabska-Barwinska et\nal. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question of whether neural responses are\nproportionally related to the encoded probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional\nto the logarithm of ",
