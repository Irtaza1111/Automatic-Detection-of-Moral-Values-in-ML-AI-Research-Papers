Davis1\n1 Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of Maryland, College Park\n2 Dept. of Computer and Information Sciences, Univ. of Pennsylvania\nagupta@cs.umd.edu, jshi@cis.upenn.edu, lsd@cs.umd.edu\nAbstract\nWe present an approach that combines bag-of-words and spatial models to perform\nsemantic and syntactic analysis for recognition of an object based on its internal\nappearance and its context. We argue that while object recognition requires mod-\neling relative spatial locations of image features within the object, a bag-of-word\nis sufﬁcient for representing context. Learning such a model from weakly labeled\ndata involves labeling of features into two classes: foreground(object) or “infor-\nmative” background(context). We present a “shape-aware” model which utilizes\ncontour information for efﬁcient and accurate labeling of features in the image.\nOur approach iterates between an",
