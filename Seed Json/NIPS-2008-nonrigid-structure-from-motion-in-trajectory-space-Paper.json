In contrast, we pro-\npose that the evolving 3D structure be described by a linear combination of basis\ntrajectories. The principal advantage of this approach is that we do not need to\nestimate any basis vectors during computation. We show that generic bases over\ntrajectories, such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis, can be used to\ncompactly describe most real motions. This results in a signiﬁcant reduction in\nunknowns, and corresponding stability in estimation. We report empirical per-\nformance, quantitatively using motion capture data, and qualitatively on several\nvideo sequences exhibiting nonrigid motions including piece-wise rigid motion,\npartially nonrigid motion (such as a facial expression), and highly nonrigid motion\n(such as a person dancing).\n1 Introduction\nNonrigid structure from motion is the process of recovering the time varying 3D coordinates of\npoints on a deforming object from their 2D locations in an image sequence. Factorization ap-\nproaches, ﬁrst proposed for recovering rigid structure by Tomasi and Kanade in [1], were extended\nto handle nonrigidity in the seminal paper by Bregler et al. in [2]. The key idea in [2] is that ob-\nserved shapes can be represented as a linear combination of a compact set of basis shapes. Each\ninstantaneous structure, such as the mouth of a smiling actor shown in Figure 1(a), is expressed\nas a point in the linear space of shapes spanned by the shape basis. A number of approaches that\ndevelop the use of shape basis have subsequently been proposed, including [3, 4, 5]. Since the space\nof spatial deformations is highly object speciﬁc, the shape basis need to be estimated anew for each\nvideo sequence. The shape basis of a mouth smiling, for instance, cannot be recycled to compactly\nrepresent a person walking.\nIn this paper, we posit that representing nonrigid structure as a combination of basis shapes is one\nof two ways of looking at the space-time structure induced by P points seen across F frames. In-\nstead of a shape space representation, we propose looking across time, representing the time-varying\nstructure of a nonrigid object as a linear combination of a set of basis trajectories, as illustrated in\nFigure 1(b). The principal advantage of taking this “lateral” approach arises from the fact that com-\npact representation in trajectory space is better motivated physically than compact representation in\nshape space. To see this, consider a deformable object being acted upon by a force. The extent\nof its deformation is limited by the force that can be applied. Hence, a tree swaying in the wind\nor a person walking cannot arbitrarily and randomly deform; the trajectories of their points are a\nfunction of the speed of the wind and the ﬂexing of muscles respectively. Deformations are, there-\n/K71\n/K31\n/K71\n/K32\n/K71\n/K33\n/K53\n/K31\n/K53\n/K32\n/K53\n/K33\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1: 3D points on a smiling mouth: a comparison of shape and trajectory space. (a) In approaches that\nrepresent the time varying structure in shape space, all 3D points observed at one time instant are projected onto\na single point in the shape space. S1, S2, · · ·, Sk each represent a shape basis vector. (b) In our approach, we\nrepresent the time varying structure in trajectory space, where a 3D point’s trajectory over time is projected to\na single point in the trajectory space. θ1, θ2, · · ·, θk each represent a trajectory basis vector. P points observed\nacross F frames are expressed as F projected points in shape space and P points in trajectory space.\nfore, constrained by the physical limits of actuation to remain incremental, not random, across time.\nSince this property is, to a large degree, ubiquitous, basis can be deﬁned in trajectory that areobject\nindependent.\nWe show that while the inherent representative power of both shape and trajectory projections of\nstructure data are equal (a duality exists), the signiﬁcant reduction in number of unknowns that\nresults from knowing the basis apriori allows us to handle much more nonrigidity of deformation\nthan state of the art methods, like [4] and [5]. In fact, most previous results consider deformations\nwhich have a large rigid component, such as talking-head videos or the motion of a swimming\nshark. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to show reasonable reconstructions of highly\nnonrigid motions from a single video sequence without making object speciﬁc assumptions. For all\nresults, we use the same trajectory basis, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis, underlining\nthe generic nature of the trajectory space representation. A useful byproduct of this approach is\nthat structure is automatically compressed for compact transmission without the need for post facto\ncompression or the overhead transmission of object speciﬁc basis.\n2 Related work\nIf deformation of a 3D scene is unconstrained, the structure observed in each image would be in-\ndependent of those in other images. In this case, recovering structure from motion is ill-posed,\nequivalent to ﬁnding 3D structure from a single 2D image at each time instant. To make nonrigid\nstructure recovery tractable, some consistency in the deformation of structure has to be imposed.\nOne early measure of consistency that was applied assumes that the scene consists of multiple rigid\nobjects which are moving independently [6, 7, 8]. However, the ﬁrstgeneral solution to the problem\nof nonrigid structure recovery was introduced by Bregleret al. in [2], approximating the structure at\neach time instant as a linear combination of basis shapes. They recovered the structure, the shape ba-\nsis and the camera rotations simultaneously, by exploiting orthonormality constraints of the rotation\nmatrices. Xiao et al. [4] showed that these orthonormality constraints alone lead to ambiguity in the\nsolution, and introduced additional constraints to remove ambiguity. In [9] Xiao et al. proposed a\nrank deﬁcient basis. Other extensions of the work by Bregleret al. include [10] which improved the\nnumerical stability of the estimation process and [3] which introduced a Gaussian prior on the shape\ncoefﬁcients. Common to all of these approaches is that results are shown on objects which have a\nsigniﬁcant number of points that move rigidly, such as faces. Some approaches, such as [11] make\nexplicit use of this fact to initialize rotation matrices, while others favor such sequences for stability\nin estimation.\nIn contrast to this entire corpus of work, which approximate structure by a shape basis, we propose a\nnew representation of time varying structure, as a collection of trajectories. We not only demonstrate\nthat a compact trajectory space can be deﬁned, but also that the basis of this trajectory space can\nbe pre-deﬁned, removing a large number of unknowns from the estimation process altogether. The\nduality of spatial and temporal representations has been hinted at earlier in literature. Shashua [12]\ndiscusses the duality of the joint image space and the joint point space in the context of multiview\ngeometry. Zelnik-Manor and Irani [13] have exploited a similar duality for an alternate approach to\n=\n/K61\n/K78 /K31\n/K2B\n/K61\n/K78 /K32\n/K2E/K2E/K2E\n/K2B\n/K61\n/K78 /K6B\nFigure\n2: As described in Equation 3, each trajectory is represented as a linear combination of k predeﬁned\nbasis trajectories. In this paper, we use DCT basis to compactly represent trajectories.\nsegmenting video sequences. Ours is the ﬁrst paper to use this dual representation in the structure\nfrom motion problem, and to note that a generic basis can be deﬁned in trajectory space which\ncompactly represents most real trajectories.\n3 Representing Nonrigid Structure\nThe structure at a time instant t can be represented by arranging the 3D locations of the P points in\na matrix S(t) ∈ R3×P ,\nS(t) =\n[Xt1 XtP\nYt1 · · ·YtP\nZt1 ZtP\n]\n.\nThe complete time varying structure can be represented by concatenating these instantaneous struc-\ntures as S3F ×P = [S (1)T S(2)T · · ·S(F )T ]T . In [2], each instantaneous shape matrix S(t) is\napproximated as a linear combination of basis shapes,\nS(t) =\n∑\nj\ncj(t)Sj, (1)\nwhere Sj ∈ R3×P is a basis shape and cj(t) is the coefﬁcient of that basis shape. If the set of\nobserved structures can be compactly expressed in terms of k such basis shapes, S has a rank of at\nmost 3k. This rank constraint can be restated by rearrangement of S as the following rank k matrix,\nS∗ =\n\n\nX11 · · ·X1P Y11 · · ·Y1P Z11 · · ·Z1P\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nXF 1 · · ·XF P YF 1 · · ·YF P ZF 1 · · ·ZF P\n\n . (2)\nThe row space of this matrix corresponds to the shape space. Since the row and column space of a\nmatrix are of equal dimension, it follows that the columns of S∗ are also spanned by k vectors. We\ncall the column space of this matrix the trajectory space and note that it enjoys a dual relationship\nwith the shape space. Speciﬁcally, if the time varying shape of an object can be expressed by a\nminimum of k shape basis, then there exist exactly k trajectory basis vectors that can represent the\nsame time varying shape.\nTo represent the time varying structure in terms of trajectory basis, we consider the structure\nas a set of trajectories, T (i) = [T x(i)T Ty(i)T Tz(i)T ]T , (see Figure 1(b)) where Tx(i) =\n[X1i, · · ·, XF i]T , T y(i) = [Y 1i, · · ·, YF i]T , T z(i) = [Z 1i, · · ·, ZF i]T are the x, y, and z coordinates\nof the ith trajectory. As illustrated in Figure 2, we describe each trajectory as a linear combination\nof basis trajectory,\nTx(i) =\nk∑\nj=1\naxj(i)θj, T y(i) =\nk∑\nj=1\nayj (i)θj, T z(i) =\nk∑\nj=1\nazj (i)θj, (3)\nwhere θj ∈ RF is a trajectory basis vector and axj(i), ayj (i) and azj (i) are the coefﬁcients corre-\nsponding to that basis vector. The time varying structure matrix can then be factorized into an inverse\nprojection matrix and coefﬁcient matrix as S3F ×P = Θ3F ×3kA3k×P , where A = [ AT\nx AT\ny AT\nz ]T\nand\nAx =\n\n\nax1(1) · · ·ax1(P )\n...\n...\naxk(1) · · ·axk(P )\n\n , Θ =\n\n\n\n\nθT\n1\nθT\n1\nθT\n1\n...\nθT\nF\nθT\nF\nθT\nF\n\n\n\n\n, (4)\nHere θi represents\na truncated basis for transformation from coefﬁcient space to original space. The\nprincipal beneﬁt of the trajectory space representation is that a basis can be pre-deﬁned that can\ncompactly approximate most real trajectories. A number of bases such as the Hadamard Transform\nbasis, the Discrete Fourier Transform basis, and the Discrete Wavelet Transform basis can all com-\npactly represent trajectories in an object independent way. In this paper, we use the Discrete Cosine\nTransform basis set to generate Θ (shown in Figure 2) for all reconstructions results shown. The\nefﬁcacy of the DCT basis has been demonstrated for compressing motion capture data, [14], and has\nbeen effective in our experiments as well.\n4 Nonrigid Structure and Motion Factorization\nThe measured 2D trajectories are contained in a 2F × P measurement matrix W, containing the\nlocation of P image points across F frames,\nW =\n\n\nu11 . . . u 1P\nv11 . . . v 1P\n...\n...\nuF 1 . . . u F P\nvF 1 . . . v F P\n\n .\nThis measurement matrix can be decomposed as W = RS where R is a 2F × 3F matrix,\nR =\n\n\nR1\n...\nRF\n\n ,\nand Rt is a 2 × 3 orthographic projection matrix. In the previous section we showed that S = ΘA,\nas a result we can further factorize W as\nW = RΘA = ΛA, (5)\nwhere Λ = RΘ. Since Λ is a 3F × 3k matrix, the rank of matrix W will be at most 3k. This is a\ndual property to the rank constraint deﬁned by [2]. We can use SVD to factorize W as,\nW = ˆΛ ˆA.\nIn general, the matrix ˆΛ and ˆA will not be equal to Λ and A respectively, because the above factor-\nization is not unique. For any invertible 3k × 3k matrix Q, ˆΛQ and Q−1A are also valid factoriza-\ntions. Therefore, to recover metric structure we need to estimate the rectiﬁcation matrixQ such that\nthe following equations hold true,\nΛ = ˆΛQ, A = Q−1 ˆA. (6)\n5 Metric Upgrade\nThe problem of recovering the rotation and structure is reduced to estimating the rectiﬁcation matrix\nQ. The elements of matrix Λ are,\nΛ =\n\n\nr1\n1θT\n1 r1\n2θT\n1 r1\n3θT\n1\nr1\n4θT\n1 r1\n5θT\n1 r1\n6θT\n1\n..\n.\nrF\n1 θT\nF rF\n2 θT\nF rF\n3 θT\nF\nrF\n4 θT\nF rF\n5 θT\nF rF\n6 θT\nF\n\n\n.\nInstead of estimating the whole matrix Q, to rectify ˆΛ and ˆA it is sufﬁcient to estimate only three\ncolumns of Q. Let us deﬁne Q|||to be the ﬁrst, k + 1st and 2k + 1st columns of the matrix Q. From\nEquation 6, if we just use Q|||instead of Q, we get\nˆΛQ|||=\n\n\nθ1,1R1\n...\nθF,1RF\n\n .

Reconstruction stability\nis measured in terms of condition number of matrix ΛT Λ with different values of k and different\nvalues of F . Synthetic rotations were generated by revolving the camera around the z-axis and\ncamera motion was measured in terms of the angle the camera moved per frame.\nThis equation shows that the unknowns in matrix Q|||can be found by exploiting the fact that Ri\nis a truncated rotation matrix (as was done in [1]). Speciﬁcally, if ˆΛ2i−1:2i denotes the two rows of\nmatrix ˆΛ at positions 2i − 1 and 2i, then we have\nˆΛ2i−1:2iQ|||QT\n|||ˆΛT\n2i−1:2i = θ2\ni,1I2×2, (8)\nwhere I2×2 is an identity matrix, giving three indepedent constraints for each image i. Therefore\nfor F frames, we have 3F constraints and 9k unknowns in Q|||. Hence at least 3k non-degenerate\nimages are required to estimate Q|||. Once Q|||has been computed, using a nonlinear minimization\nroutine (e.g. Levenberg Marquardt), we can estimate the rotation matrices, and therefore R, using\nEquation 7.\nOnce R is known, it can be multiplied with the (known) DCT basis matrix Θ3F ×3k to recover\nthe matrix Λ2F ×3k = R2F ×3F Θ3F ×3k. The coefﬁcients can then be estimated by solving the\nfollowing overconstrained linear system of equations,\nΛ2F ×3k ˆA3k×P = W2F ×P . (9)\n6 Results\nThe proposed algorithm has been validated quantitatively on motion capture data over different\nactions and qualitatively on video data. We have tested the approach extensively on highly nonrigid\nhuman motion like volleyball digs, handstands, karate moves and dancing. Figure 4 shows a few\nsample reconstructions of different actors. As mentioned earlier, we choose DCT as the basis for\nthe trajectory space. In subsequent experiments, we compare our approach with [5] and [9] (we use\ncode kindly provided by the respective authors). The results, data and the code used to produce the\nresults are all shared athttp://cvlab.lums.edu.pk/nrsfm.\nIn nonrigid structure from motion, the key relationship that determines successful reconstruction\nis the one between the degree of deformation of the object, measured by the number of basis k\nrequired to approximate it and the degree of camera motion. To test the relationship between k,\ncamera motion and reconstruction stability, we constructed Λ matrices using different values of k\nand synthetic rotations around the z-axis, at various magnitudes of motion per frame. In Figure 3,\nthe reconstruction stability, measured by the condition number of ΛT Λ, is shown as k is varied\nbetween 2 and 6, for 200, 400, and 800 frames (at different angular velocities per frame). The plots\nconﬁrm intuition: the smaller the degree of object deformation and the larger the camera motion,\nthe more stable reconstruction tends to be.\nFor quantitative evaluation of reconstruction accuracy we used the drink, pickup, yoga, stretch,\nand dance actions from the CMU Mocap database, and the shark dataset of [3]. Multiple rigid\nbody data was generated by simulation of points on rigidly moving cubes. We generated synthetic\ncamera rotations and projected 3D data using these rotations to get image observations. The camera\nrotation for the Mocap datasets was 5 degrees per frame and 2 degrees per frame for the multi-body\n0 50 100 150\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n0 50 100 150\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0 50 100 150\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n/K56 /K6F/K6C/K6C/K65/K79/K62/K61/K6C/K6C/K20/K44/K69/K67\n/K58 /K2D/K63/K6F/K6F/K72/K64/K69/K6E/K61/K74/K65/K20\n/K20/K20/K20/K6F/K66/K20/K68/K65/K61/K64\n/K58 /K2D/K63/K6F/K6F/K72/K64/K69/K6E/K61/K74/K65/K20\n/K20/K20/K20/K6F/K66/K20/K68/K61/K6E/K64\n/K58 /K2D/K63/K6F/K6F/K72/K64/K69/K6E/K61/K74/K65/K20\n/K20/K20/K20/K20/K6F/K66/K20/K66/K6F/K6F/K74\n0 50 100 150\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0 50 100 150\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0 50 100 150\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n/K48/K61/K6E/K64/K2D/K73/K74/K61/K6E/K64/K20\n/K53/K6C/K69/K70/K20/K61/K6E/K64/K20/K46/K61/K6C/K6C\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nFigure\n4: Simultaneous reconstruction accuracy for three actors.

We did not rotate the camera for the dance and shark sequences, since the object itself was\nrotating in these sequences. In obtaining the results discussed below, k was chosen to provide the\nbest reconstructions, the value varying between 2 and 13 depending on the length of the sequence\nand the nonrigidity of motion. We normalize the structure, so that the average standard deviation\nof the structure matrix S becomes equal to unity (to make comparison of error across datasets more\nmeaningful).\nTable 1 shows a quantitative comparison of our method with the shape basis approach of Torresani\net al. [5] and Xiao and Kanade [9]. This table shows both the camera rotation estimation error and\nstructure reconstruction error. The estimated structure is valid up to a 3D rotation and translation\nand the estimated rotations also have a 3D rotation ambiguity. We therefore align them for error\nmeasurement. Procrustes analysis was used for aligning camera rotations and the 3D structure. The\nerror measure for camera rotations was the average Frobenius norm difference between the original\ncamera rotation and the estimated camera rotation. For structure evaluation we compute the per\nframe mean squared error between original 3D points and the estimated 3D points.\nFinally, to test the proposed approach on real data, we used a face sequence from the PIE dataset,\na sequence from the movie “The Matrix”, a sequence capturing two rigidly moving cubes and a\nsequence of a toy dinosaur moving nonrigidly.

Unlike earlier approaches that require an object-speciﬁc shape basis\nto be estimated for each new video sequence, we demonstrate that a generic trajectory basis can\nbe deﬁned that can compactly represent the motion of a wide variety of real deformations. Results\nare shown using the DCT basis to recover structures of piece-wise rigid motion, facial expressions,\nactors dancing, walking, and doing yoga. Our experiments show that there is a relationship between\ncamera motion, degree of object deformation, and reconstruction stability. We observe that as the\nmotion of the camera increases with respect to the degree of deformation, the reconstruction stability\nincreases. Future directions of research include experimenting with different unitary transform bases\nto verify that DCT basis are, in fact, the best generic basis to use, and developing a synergistic\napproach to use both shape and trajectory bases concurrently.\n8 Acknowledgements\nThis research was partially supported by a grant from the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Fernando De La Torre for useful discussions.
