We focus on\nprivacy-preserving logistic regression. First we apply an idea of Dwork et al. [6]\nto design a privacy-preserving logistic regression algorithm. This involves bound-\ning the sensitivity of regularized logistic regression, and perturbing the learned\nclassiﬁer with noise proportional to the sensitivity.\nWe then provide a privacy-preserving regularized logistic regression algorithm\nbased on a new privacy-preserving technique: solving a perturbed optimization\nproblem. We prove that our algorithm preserves privacy in the model due to [6].\nWe provide learning guarantees for both algorithms, which are tighter for our new\nalgorithm, in cases in which one would typically apply logistic regression. Ex-\nperiments demonstrate improved learning performance of our method, versus the\nsensitivity method. Our privacy-preserving technique does not depend on the sen-\nsitivity of the function, and extends easily to a class of convex loss functions. Our\nwork also reveals an interesting connection between regularization and privacy.\n1 Introduction\nPrivacy-preserving machine learning is an emerging problem, due in part to the increased reliance on\nthe internet for day-to-day tasks such as banking, shopping, and social networking. Moreover, pri-\nvate data such as medical and ﬁnancial records are increasingly being digitized, stored, and managed\nby independent companies. In the literature on cryptography and information security, data privacy\ndeﬁnitions have been proposed, however designing machine learning algorithms that adhere to them\nhas not been well-explored. On the other hand, data-mining algorithms have been introduced that\naim to respect other notions of privacy that may be less formally justiﬁed.\nOur goal is to bridge the gap between approaches in the cryptography and information security com-\nmunity, and those in the data-mining community. This is necessary, as there is a tradeoff between\nthe privacy of a protocol, and the learnability of functions that respect the protocol. In addition to\nthe speciﬁc contributions of our paper, we hope to encourage the machine learning community to\nembrace the goals of privacy-preserving machine learning, as it is still a ﬂedgling endeavor.\nIn this work, we provide algorithms for learning in a privacy model introduced by Dwork et al. [6].\nTheϵ-differential privacy model limits how much information an adversary can gain about a par-\nticular private value, by observing a function learned from a database containing that value, even if\nshe knows every other value in the database. An initial positive result [6] in this setting depends on\nthe sensitivity of the function to be learned, which is the maximum amount the function value can\nchange due to an arbitrary change in one input. Using this method requires bounding the sensitivity\nof the function class to be learned, and then adding noise proportional to the sensitivity. This might\nbe difﬁcult for some functions that are important for machine learning.\n∗The majority of this work was done while at UC San Diego.\n1\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows. First we apply the sensitivity-based method of design-\ning privacy-preserving algorithms [6] to a speciﬁc machine learning algorithm, logistic regression.\nThen we present a second privacy-preserving logistic regression algorithm. The second algorithm is\nbased on solving a perturbed objective function, and does not depend on the sensitivity. We prove\nthat the new method is private in theϵ-differential privacy model. We provide learning performance\nguarantees for both algorithms, which are tighter for our new algorithm, in cases in which one would\ntypically apply logistic regression. Finally, we provide experiments demonstrating superior learning\nperformance of our new method, with respect to the algorithm based on [6]. Our technique may have\nbroader applications, and we show that it can be applied to certain classes of optimization problems.\n1.1 Overview and related work\nAt the ﬁrst glance, it may seem that anonymizing a data-set – namely, stripping it of identifying\ninformation about individuals, such as names, addresses, etc – is sufﬁcient to preserve privacy.\nHowever, this is problematic, because an adversary may have some auxiliary information, which\nmay even be publicly available, and which can be used to breach privacy. For more details on such\nattacks, see [12].\nTo formally address this issue, we need a deﬁnition of privacy which works in the presence of\nauxiliary knowledge by the adversary. The deﬁnition we use is due to Dworket al. [6], and has been\nused in several applications [4, 11, 2]. We explain this deﬁnition and privacy model in more detail\nin Section 2.\nPrivacy and learning. The work most related to ours is [8] and [3]. [8] shows how to ﬁnd classiﬁers\nthat preserveϵ-differential privacy; however, their algorithm takes time exponential in d for inputs\nin Rd. [3] provides a general method for publishing data-sets while preservingϵ-differential privacy\nsuch that the answers to all queries of a certain type with low VC-dimension are approximately\ncorrect. However, their algorithm can also be computationally inefﬁcient.\nAdditional related work. There has been a substantial amount of work on privacy in the literature,\nspanning several communities. Much work on privacy has been done in the data-mining community\n[1, 7], [14, 10], however the privacy deﬁnitions used in these papers are different, and some are sus-\nceptible to attacks when the adversary has some prior information. In contrast, the privacy deﬁnition\nwe use avoids these attacks, and is very strong.\n2 Sensitivity and the ϵ-differential privacy model\nBefore we deﬁne the privacy model that we study, we will note a few preliminary points. Both in\nthat model, and for our algorithm and analyses, we assume that each value in the database is a real\nvector with norm at most one. That is, a database contains values x1,...,x n, where xi ∈ Rd,\nand∥xi∥≤ 1 for all i∈{1,...,n }. This assumption is used in the privacy model. In addition,\nwe assume that when learning linear separators, the best separator passes through the origin. Note\nthat this is not an assumption that the data is separable, but instead an assumption that a vector’s\nclassiﬁcation is based on its angle, regardless of its norm.\nIn both privacy-preserving logistic regression algorithms that we state, the output is a parameter\nvector,w, which makes prediction SGN(w·x), on a point x. For a vector x, we use||x|| to denote\nits Euclidean norm. For a functionG(x) deﬁned on Rd, we use∇G to denote its gradient and∇2G\nto denote its Hessian.\nPrivacy Deﬁnition. The privacy deﬁnition we use is due to Dworket al. [6, 5]. In this model, users\nhave access to private data about individuals through a sanitization mechanism, usually denoted by\nM. The interaction between the sanitization mechanism and an adversary is modelled as a sequence\nof queries, made by the adversary, and responses, made by the sanitizer. The sanitizer, which is\ntypically a randomized algorithm, is said to preserve ϵ-differential privacy, if the private value of\nany one individual in the data set does not affect the likelihood of a speciﬁc answer by the sanitizer\nby more thanϵ.\nMore formally,ϵ-differential privacy can be deﬁned as follows.\n2\nDeﬁnition 1 A randomized mechanism M providesϵ-differential privacy, if, for all databases D1\nandD2 which differ by at most one element, and for anyt,\nPr[M(D1) =t]\nPr[M(D2) =t]≤eϵ\nIt was shown in [6] that if a mechanism satisﬁesϵ-differential privacy, then an adversary who knows\nthe private value of all the individuals in the data-set, except for one single individual, cannot ﬁgure\nout the private value of the unknown individual, with sufﬁcient conﬁdence, from the responses of\nthe sanitizer.ϵ-differential privacy is therefore a very strong notion of privacy.\n[6] also provides a general method for computing an approximation to any functionf while preserv-\ningϵ-differential privacy. Before we can describe their method, we need a deﬁnition.\nDeﬁnition 2 For any functionf withn inputs, we deﬁne the sensitivityS(f) as the maximum, over\nall inputs, of the difference in the value off when one input off is changed. That is,\nS(f) = max\n(a,a′)\n|f(x1,...,x n−1,xn =a)−f(x1,...,x n−1,xn =a′)|\n[6] shows that for any inputx1,...,x n, releasingf(x1,...,x n) +η, whereη is a random variable\ndrawn from a Laplace distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation S(f )\nϵ preservesϵ-differential\nprivacy.\nIn [13], Nissim et al. showed that given any input x to a function, and a function f, it is sufﬁcient\nto drawη from a Laplace distribution with standard deviationSS (f )\nϵ , whereSS(f) is the smoothed-\nsensitivity of f around x. Although this method sometimes requires adding a smaller amount of\nnoise to preserve privacy, in general, smoothed sensitivity of a function can be hard to compute.\n3 A Simple Algorithm\nBased on [6], one can come up with a simple algorithm for privacy-preserving logistic regression,\nwhich adds noise to the classiﬁer obtained by logistic regression, proportional to its sensitivity. From\nCorollary 2, the sensitivity of logistic regression is at most 2\nnλ. This leads to Algorithm 1, which\nobeys the privacy guarantees in Theorem 1.\nAlgorithm 1:\n1. Compute w∗, the classiﬁer obtained by regularized logistic regression on the labelled ex-\namples (x1,y 1),..., (xn,yn).\n2. Pick a noise vector η according to the following density function: h(η) ∝ e−nϵλ\n2 ||η||.\nTo pick such a vector, we choose the norm of η from the Γ(d, 2\nnϵλ) distribution, and the\ndirection ofη uniformly at random.\n3. Output w∗ +η.\nTheorem 1 Let (x1,y 1),..., (xn,yn) be a set of labelled points over Rd such that||xi||≤ 1 for\nalli. Then, Algorithm 1 preservesϵ-differential privacy.\nPROOF : The proof follows by a combination of [6], and Corollary 2, which states that the sensitivity\nof logistic regression is at most 2\nnλ. □\nLemma 1 LetG(w) andg(w) be two convex functions, which are continuous and differentiable at\nall points. Ifw1 = argminwG(w) andw2 = argminwG(w) +g(w), then,||w1−w2||≤ g1\nG2\n. Here,\ng1 = maxw||∇g(w)|| andG2 = minv minwvT∇2G(w)v, for any unit vectorv.\nThe main idea of the proof is to examine the gradient and the Hessian of the functions G and g\naroundw1 andw2. Due to lack of space, the full proof appears in the full version of our paper.\nCorollary 2 Given a set ofn examplesx1,...,x n in Rd, with labelsy1,...,y n, such that for alli,\n||xi||≤ 1, the sensitivity of logistic regression with regularization parameterλ is at most 2\nnλ.\n3\nPROOF : We use a triangle inequality and the fact thatG2≥λ andg1≤ 1\nn. □\nLearning Performance. In order to assess the performance of Algorithm 1, we ﬁrst try to bound\nthe performance of Algorithm 1 on the training data. To do this, we need to deﬁne some notation.\nFor a classiﬁer w, we use L(w) to denote the expected loss of w over the data distribution, and\nˆL(w) to denote the empirical average loss of w over the training data. In other words, ˆL(w) =\n1\nn\n∑n\ni=1 log(1 +e−yiwTxi), where, (xi,yi),i = 1,...,n are the training examples.\nFurther, for a classiﬁer w, we use the notation fλ(w) to denote the quantity 1\n2λ||w||2 +L(w) and\nˆfλ(w) to denote the quantity 1\n2λ||w||2 + ˆL(w). Our guarantees on this algorithm can be summarized\nby the following lemma.\nLemma 3 Given a logistic regression problem with regularization parameterλ, letw1 be the classi-\nﬁer that minimizes ˆfλ, andw2 be the classiﬁer output by Algorithm 1 respectively. Then, with prob-\nability 1−δ over the randomness in the privacy mechanism, ˆfλ(w2)≤ ˆfλ(w1) + 2d2(1+λ) log2(d/δ)\nλ2n2ϵ2 .\nDue to lack of space, the proof is deferred to the full version.\nFrom Lemma 3, we see that performance of Algorithm 1 degrades with decreasingλ, and is poor in\nparticular whenλ is very small. One question is, can we get a privacy-preserving approximation to\nlogistic regression, which has better performance bounds for small λ? To explore this, in the next\nsection, we look at a different algorithm.\n4 A New Algorithm\nIn this section, we provide a new privacy-preserving algorithm for logistic regression. The input to\nour algorithm is a set of examples x1,...,x n over Rd such that||xi||≤ 1 for alli, a set of labels\ny1,...,y n for the examples, a regularization constantλ and a privacy parameterϵ, and the output is\na vectorw∗ in Rd. Our algorithm works as follows.\nAlgorithm 2:\n1. We pick a random vector b from the density function h(b)∝ e−ϵ\n2||b||. To implement this,\nwe pick the norm of b from the Γ(d, 2\nϵ ) distribution, and the direction of b uniformly at\nrandom.\n2. Given examples x1,...,x n, with labels y1,...,y n and a regularization constant λ, we\ncomputew∗ = argminw\n1\n2λwTw + bTw\nn + 1\nn\n∑n\ni=1 log(1 +e−yiwTxi). Outputw∗.\nWe observe that our method solves a convex programming problem very similar to the logistic\nregression convex program, and therefore it has running time similar to that of logistic regression.\nIn the sequel, we show that the output of Algorithm 2 is privacy preserving.\nTheorem 2 Given a set of n examplesx1,...,x n over Rd, with labels y1,...,y n, where for each\ni,||xi||≤ 1, the output of Algorithm 2 preservesϵ-differential privacy.\nPROOF : Let a and a′ be any two vectors over Rd with norm at most 1, and y,y′ ∈\n{−1, 1}. For any such (a,y ), (a′,y′), consider the inputs (x1,y 1),..., (xn−1,yn−1), (a,y ) and\n(x1,y 1)..., (xn−1,yn−1), (a′,y′). Then, for any w∗ output by our algorithm, there is a unique\nvalue ofb that maps the input to the output. This uniqueness holds, because both the regularization\nfunction and the loss functions are differentiable everywhere.\nLet the values ofb for the ﬁrst and second cases respectively, beb1 andb2.\nSince w∗ is the value that minimizes both the optimization problems, the derivative of both opti-\nmization functions atw∗ is 0.\nThis implies that for every b1 in the ﬁrst case, there exists a b2 in the second case such that: b1−\nya\n1+eyw∗Ta = b2− y′a′\n1+ey′w∗Ta′ . Since||a||≤ 1,||a′||≤ 1, and 1\n1+eyw∗Ta ≤ 1, and 1\n1+ey′w∗Ta′ ≤ 1\n4\nfor anyw∗,||b1−b2||≤ 2. Using the triangle inequality,||b1||− 2≤||b2||≤|| b1|| + 2. Therefore,\nfor any pair (a,y ), (a′,y′),\nPr[w∗|x1,...,x n−1,y 1,...,y n−1,xn =a,yn =y]\nPr[w∗|x1,...,x n−1,y 1,...,y n−1,xn =a′,yn =y′] = h(b1)\nh(b2) =e−ϵ\n2 (||b1||−||b2||)\nwhereh(bi) fori = 1, 2 is the density ofbi. Since−2≤||b 1||−|| b2||≤ 2, this ratio is at most eϵ.\ntheorem follows. □\nWe notice that the privacy guarantee for our algorithm does not depend onλ; in other words, for any\nvalue ofλ, our algorithm is private. On the other hand, as we show in Section 5, the performance of\nour algorithm does degrade with decreasing λ in the worst case, although the degradation is better\nthan that of Algorithm 1 forλ< 1.\nOther Applications. Our algorithm for privacy-preserving logistic regression can be generalized to\nprovide privacy-preserving outputs for more general convex optimization problems, so long as the\nproblems satisfy certain conditions. These conditions can be formalized in the theorem below.\nTheorem 3 LetX ={x1,...,x n} be a database containing private data of individuals. Suppose\nwe would like to compute a vector w that minimizes the function F (w) = G(w) + ∑n\ni=1l(w,xi),\noverw∈Rd for somed, such that all of the following hold:\n1. G(w) andl(w,xi) are differentiable everywhere, and have continuous derivatives\n2. G(w) is strongly convex andl(w,xi) are convex for alli\n3. ||∇wl(w,x )||≤ κ, for anyx.\nLetb = B· ˆb, whereB is drawn from Γ(d, 2κ\nϵ ), and ˆb is drawn uniformly from the surface of a d-\ndimensional unit sphere. Then, computingw∗, wherew∗ = argminwG(w) +∑n\ni=1l(w,xi) +bTw,\nprovidesϵ-differential privacy.\n5 Learning Guarantees\nIn this section, we show theoretical bounds on the number of samples required by the algorithms to\nlearn a linear classiﬁer. For the rest of the section, we use the same notation used in Section 3.\nFirst we show that, for Algorithm 2, the values of ˆfλ(w2) and ˆfλ(w1) are close.\nLemma 4 Given a logistic regression problem with regularization parameterλ, letw1 be the clas-\nsiﬁer that minimizes ˆfλ, and w2 be the classiﬁer output by Algorithm 2 respectively. Then, with\nprobability 1−δ over the randomness in the privacy mechanism, ˆfλ(w2)≤ ˆfλ(w1) + 8d2 log2(d/δ)\nλn2ϵ2 .\nThe proof is in the full version of our paper. As desired, forλ< 1, we have attained a tighter bound\nusing Algorithm 2, than Lemma 3 for Algorithm 1.\nNow we give a performance guarantee for Algorithm 2.\nTheorem 4 Letw0 be a classiﬁer with expected lossL over the data distribution. If the training ex-\namples are drawn independently from the data distribution, and ifn>C max(||w0||2\nϵ2\ng\n, d log(d\nδ )||w0||\nϵgϵ ),\nfor some constant C, then, with probability 1−δ, the classiﬁer output by Algorithm 2 has loss at\nmostL +ϵg over the data distribution.\nPROOF : Let w∗ be the classiﬁer that minimizesfλ(w) over the data distribution, and letw1 andw2\nbe the classiﬁers that minimize ˆfλ(w) and ˆfλ(w) + bTw\nn over the data distribution respectively. We\ncan use an analysis as in [15] to write that:\nL(w2) =L(w0) + (fλ(w2)−fλ(w∗)) + (fλ(w∗)−fλ(w0)) +λ\n2||w0||2− λ\n2||w2||2 (1)\n5\nNotice that from Lemma 4, ˆfλ(w2)− ˆfλ(w1)≤ 8d2 log2(d/δ)\nλn2ϵ2 . Using this and [16], we can bound\nthe second quantity in equation 1 as fλ(w2)−fλ(w∗)≤ 16d2 log2(d/δ)\nλn2ϵ2 +O( 1\nλn). By deﬁnition of\nw∗, the third quantity in Equation 1 is non-positive. Ifλ is set to be ϵg\n||w0||2 , then, the fourth quantity\nin Equation 1 is at most ϵg\n2 . Now, ifn>C ·||w0||2\nϵ2\ng\nfor a suitable constantC, 1\nλn≤ ϵg\n4 . In addition,\nifn > C·||w0||d log(d\nδ )\nϵϵg\n, then, 16d2 log2(d\nδ )\nλn2ϵ2 ≤ ϵg\n4 . In either case, the total loss of the classiﬁer w2\noutput by Algorithm 2 is at mostL(w0) +ϵg.\n□\nThe same technique can be used to analyze the sensitivity-based algorithm, using Lemma 3, which\nyields the following.\nTheorem 5 Let w0 be a classiﬁer with expected loss L over the data distribution. If\nthe training examples are drawn independently from the data distribution, and if n >\nC max(||w0||2\nϵ2\ng\n, d log(d\nδ )||w0||\nϵgϵ , d log(d\nδ )||w0||2\nϵ3/2\ng ϵ ), for some constant C, then, with probability 1−δ, the\nclassiﬁer output by Algorithm 2 has loss at mostL +ϵg over the data distribution.\nIt is clear that this bound is never lower than the bound for Algorithm 2. Note that for problems in\nwhich (non-private) logistic regression performs well,∥w0∥≥ 1 ifw0 has low loss, since otherwise\none can show that the loss of w0 would be lower bounded by log(1 + 1\ne). Thus the performance\nguarantee for Algorithm 2 is signiﬁcantly stronger than for Algorithm 1, for problems in which one\nwould typically apply logistic regression.\n6 Results in Simulation\nUniform, margin=0.03 Unseparable (uniform with noise 0.2 in margin 0.1)\nSensitivity method 0.2962±0.0617 0.3257±0.0536\nNew method 0.1426±0.1284 0.1903±0.1105\nStandard LR 0±0.0016 0.0530±0.1105\nFigure 1: Test error: mean± standard deviation over ﬁve folds. N=17,500.\nWe include some simulations that compare the two privacy-preserving methods, and demonstrate\nthat using our privacy-preserving approach to logistic regression does not degrade learning per-\nformance terribly, from that of standard logistic regression. Performance degradation is inevitable\nhowever, as in both cases, in order to address privacy concerns, we are adding noise, either to the\nlearned classiﬁer, or to the objective.\nIn order to obtain a clean comparison between the various logistic regression variants, we ﬁrst ex-\nperimented with artiﬁcial data that is separable through the origin. Because the classiﬁcation of a\nvector by a linear separator through the origin depends only its angle, not its norm, we sampled the\ndata from the unit hypersphere. We used a uniform distribution on the hypersphere in10 dimensions\nwith zero mass within a small margin (0.03) from the generating linear separator. Then we experi-\nmented on uniform data that is not linearly separable. We sampled data from the surface of the unit\nball in 10 dimensions, and labeled it with a classiﬁer through the origin. In the band of margin≤ 0.1\nwith respect to the perfect classiﬁer, we performed random label ﬂipping with probability 0.2. For\nour experiments, we used convex optimization software provided by [9].\nFigure 1 gives mean and standard deviation of test error over ﬁve-fold cross-validation, on 17,500\npoints. In both simulations, our new method is superior to the sensitivity method, although incurs\nmore error than standard (non-private) logistic regression. For both problems, we tuned the logistic\nregression parameter, λ, to minimize the test error of standard logistic regression, using ﬁve-fold\ncross-validation on a holdout set of 10,000 points (the tuned values are: λ = 0.01 in both cases).\nFor each test error computation, the performance of each of the privacy-preserving algorithms was\nevaluated by averaging over 200 random restarts, since they are both randomized algorithms.\nIn Figure 2a)-b) we provide learning curves. We graph the test error after each increment of 1000\npoints, averaged over ﬁve-fold cross validation.

As per the deﬁnition of\nϵ-differential privacy in Section 2, strengthening the privacy guarantee corresponds to reducing ϵ.\nBoth algorithms’ learning performance degrades in this direction. For the majority of values of ϵ\nthat we tested, the new method is superior in managing the tradeoff between privacy and learning\nperformance. For very small ϵ, corresponding to extremely stringent privacy requirements, the sen-\nsitivity method performs better but also has a predication accuracy close to chance, which is not\nuseful for machine learning purposes.\n7 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we show two ways to construct a privacy-preserving linear classiﬁer through logistic\nregression. The ﬁrst one uses the methods of [6], and the second one is a new algorithm. Us-\ning the ϵ-differential privacy deﬁnition of Dwork et al. [6], we prove that our new algorithm is\nprivacy-preserving. We provide learning performance guarantees for the two algorithms, which are\ntighter for our new algorithm, in cases in which one would typically apply logistic regression. In\nsimulations, our new algorithm outperforms the method based on [6].\nOur work reveals an interesting connection between regularization and privacy: the larger the reg-\nularization constant, the less sensitive the logistic regression function is to any one individual ex-\nample, and as a result, the less noise one needs to add to make it privacy-preserving. Therefore,\nregularization not only prevents overﬁtting, but also helps with privacy, by making the classiﬁer less\n7\nsensitive. An interesting future direction would be to explore whether other methods that prevent\noverﬁtting also have such properties.\nOther future directions would be to apply our techniques to other commonly used machine-learning\nalgorithms, and to explore whether our techniques can be applied to more general optimization\nproblems. Theorem 3 shows that our method can be applied to a class of optimization problems\nwith certain restrictions. An open question would be to remove some of these restrictions.\nAcknowledgements.
